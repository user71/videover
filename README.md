video reciever

- camera.conf - file with camera credentials
- Please add videoarchive function

Ok. Everything seems to be not THAT BAD.
But VideoWriter should be improved. 
imshow should be improved.
They are not working that good with std::threads.

Hardcode values also should be improved. Architecture of the project could
be improved in the following way:
- Camera interactor should have easier interaction with VideoReceiver
- Pattern Recognition threads should have better wrappers.
